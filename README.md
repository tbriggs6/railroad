Railroad Signal Controller

The Shippensburg Railroad Museum was restoring an antique railroad signalling lantern for the museum.  They asked me if I could help them activate the signals to follow the original standard patterns (e.g. go, stop, proceed with caution).  I agreed, and designed this board and the attached code for the embedded micrcontroller.
